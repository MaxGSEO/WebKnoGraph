# Who is WebKnoGraph for?

WebKnoGraph is created for companies where content plays a central role in business growth. It is suited for mid to large-sized organizations that manage high volumes of content, often exceeding 1,000 unique pages within each structured folder, such as a blog, help center, or product documentation section.

These organizations publish regularly, with dedicated editorial workflows that add new content across folders, subdomains, or language versions. Internal linking is a key part of their SEO and content strategies. However, maintaining these links manually becomes increasingly difficult as the content volume grows.

WebKnoGraph addresses this challenge by offering AI-driven link prediction workflows. It supports teams that already work with technical SEO, semantic search, or structured content planning. It fits well into environments where companies prefer to maintain direct control over their data, models, and optimization logic rather than relying on opaque external services.

The tool is especially relevant for the following types of companies:

1. **Media and Publishing Groups**  
   Teams operating large-scale news websites, online magazines, or niche vertical content hubs.

2. **B2B SaaS Providers**  
   Companies managing growing knowledge bases, release notes, changelogs, and resource libraries.

3. **Ecommerce Brands and Marketplaces**  
   Organizations that handle thousands of product pages, category overviews, and search-optimized content.

4. **Enterprise Knowledge Platforms**  
   Firms supporting complex internal documentation across departments or in multiple languages.

WebKnoGraph empowers these organizations to scale internal linking with precision, consistency, and clarity, while keeping full control over their infrastructure.
