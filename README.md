# WebKnoGraph [👀 it out]

Revolutionizing website internal linking by leveraging cutting-edge data processing techniques, vector embeddings, and graph-based link prediction algorithms. By combining these advanced technologies and methodologies, the project aims to create an intelligent solution that optimizes internal link structures, enhancing both SEO performance and user navigation.

We're enabling **the first publicly available and transparent research for academic and industry purposes in the field of end-to-end SEO and technical marketing on a global level**. This initiative opens the door to innovation and collaboration, setting a new standard for how large-scale websites can manage and improve their internal linking strategies using AI-powered, reproducible methods.

# 👐 Who is WebKnoGraph for?

WebKnoGraph is created for companies where content plays a central role in business growth. It is suited for mid to large-sized organizations that manage high volumes of content, often exceeding 1,000 unique pages within each structured folder, such as a blog, help center, or product documentation section.

These organizations publish regularly, with dedicated editorial workflows that add new content across folders, subdomains, or language versions. Internal linking is a key part of their SEO and content strategies. However, maintaining these links manually becomes increasingly difficult as the content volume grows.

WebKnoGraph addresses this challenge by offering AI-driven link prediction workflows. It supports teams that already work with technical SEO, semantic search, or structured content planning. It fits well into environments where companies prefer to maintain direct control over their data, models, and optimization logic rather than relying on opaque external services.

The tool is especially relevant for the following types of companies:

1. **Media and Publishing Groups**:
   Teams operating large-scale news websites, online magazines, or niche vertical content hubs.

2. **B2B SaaS Providers**:
   Companies managing growing knowledge bases, release notes, changelogs, and resource libraries.

3. **Ecommerce Brands and Marketplaces**:
   Organizations that handle thousands of product pages, category overviews, and search-optimized content.

4. **Enterprise Knowledge Platforms**:
   Firms supporting complex internal documentation across departments or in multiple languages.

WebKnoGraph empowers these organizations to scale internal linking with precision, consistency, and clarity, while keeping full control over their infrastructure.

# 🚀 Setup and Running

This project is designed to be easily runnable in a Google Colab environment, leveraging Google Drive for persistent data storage.

## 1. Prerequisites

* **Google Account:** Required for Google Colab and Google Drive.
* **Python 3.8+**

## 2. Clone/Upload the Repository

1. **Clone (if using Git locally):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martech-engineer/WebKnoGraph.git
   cd WebKnoGraph
   ```
   Then, upload this `WebKnoGraph` folder to your Google Drive.

2. **Upload (if directly from Colab):**
   * Download the entire `WebKnoGraph` folder as a ZIP from the repository.
   * Unzip it.
   * Upload the `WebKnoGraph` folder directly to your Google Drive (e.g., into `My Drive/`). Ensure the internal folder structure is preserved exactly as shown in the [Project Structure](#-project-structure) section.

## 3. Google Drive Mounting

All notebooks assume your `WebKnoGraph` project is located at `/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph/` after Google Drive is mounted. This path is explicitly set in each notebook.

Each notebook's first cell contains the necessary Python code to mount your Google Drive. You will be prompted to authenticate.

```python
# Part of the first cell in each notebook
from google.colab import drive

drive.mount("/content/drive")
```

## 4. Install Dependencies

Each notebook's first cell also contains commented-out `!pip install` commands. It's recommended to:

1. Open any of the notebooks (e.g., `notebooks/crawler_ui.ipynb`).
2. Uncomment the `!pip install ...` lines in the first cell.
3. Run that first cell. This will install all necessary libraries into your Colab environment for the current session. Alternatively, you can manually run `!pip install -r requirements.txt` in a Colab cell, ensuring your requirements.txt is up to date.

5. Running the Applications (Gradio UIs)

Each module has its own dedicated Gradio UI notebook. It's recommended to run them in the following order as outputs from one serve as inputs for the next.
General Steps for Each Notebook:
* Open the desired `*.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
* Go to `Runtime` -> `Disconnect and delete runtime` (This is **CRUCIAL** for a clean start and to pick up any code changes).
* Go to `Runtime` -> `Run all cells`.
* After the cells finish executing, a Gradio UI link (local and/or public `ngrok.io` link) will appear in the output of the last cell. Click this link to interact with the application.

5.1. Content Crawler

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/crawler_ui.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Crawl a website and save content as Parquet files.
* **Default Output:** `/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph/data/crawled_data_parquet/`

5.2. Embeddings Pipeline

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/embeddings_ui.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Generate embeddings for crawled URLs.
* **Requires:** Output from the Content Crawler (`crawled_data_parquet/`).
* **Default Output:** `/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph/data/url_embeddings/`

5.3. Link Graph Extractor

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/link_crawler_ui.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Extract internal FROM, TO links and save as a CSV edge list.
* **Default Output:** `/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph/data/link_graph_edges.csv`

5.4. GNN Link Prediction & Recommendation Engine

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/link_prediction_ui.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Train a GNN model on the link graph and embeddings, then get link recommendations.
* **Requires:**
    * Output from Link Graph Extractor (`link_graph_edges.csv`).
    * Output from Embeddings Pipeline (`url_embeddings/`).
* **Default Output:** `/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph/data/prediction_model/`
* **Important Note:** After training, you must select a specific URL from the dropdown in the "Get Link Recommendations" tab for recommendations to be generated. Do not use the placeholder message.

**5.5. PageRank & HITS Analysis**

* **Notebook:** `notebooks/pagerank_ui.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** Calculate PageRank and HITS scores for URLs based on the link graph, and analyze folder depths.
* **Requires:** Output from the Link Graph Extractor (`link_graph_edges.csv`). (It also generates `url_analysis_results.csv` which is then used internally for HITS analysis).
* **Default Output:** `/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph/data/url_analysis_results.csv`

**Important Note:** After training, you must select a specific URL from the dropdown in the "Get Link Recommendations" tab for recommendations to be generated. Do not use the placeholder message.

## 6. Running All Tests in Your Project

To execute all unit tests located within the tests/backend/services/ directory and its subdirectories, navigate to the root of your WebKnoGraph project in your terminal. Once there, you can use Python's built-in unittest module with its discover command:

```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/backend/services/
   ```

### Understanding the Output

*   **python -m unittest**: This part invokes the unittest module as a script.

*   **discover**: This command tells unittest to search for and load all test cases.

*   **tests/backend/services/**: This specifies the starting directory for the test discovery process. unittest will look for any file whose name begins with test (e.g., test\_crawler\_service.py, test\_pagerank\_service.py) within this directory and any subdirectories, and then run all test methods found within the unittest.TestCase classes in those files.


A successful test run will typically show a series of dots (.) indicating passed tests. If any tests fail (F) or encounter errors (E), they will be clearly marked, and a summary of the failures/errors will be provided at the end of the output.

### Example of Successful Test Output

![GitHub Actions Test Validation](https://github.com/martech-engineer/WebKnoGraph/blob/main/assets/test_completed_1.png)

![Bash Test Validation](https://github.com/martech-engineer/WebKnoGraph/blob/main/assets/test_completed_2.png)

This output confirms that all tests in the tests/backend/services/ directory were found and executed, and the final summary will indicate if all of them passed successfully.

# ⚠️ Troubleshooting Tips

## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src':
- Ensure your `WebKnoGraph` folder is directly under `/content/drive/My Drive/`.
- Verify that `src` directory exists within `WebKnoGraph` and contains `backend/` and `shared/`.
- Make sure the `project_root` variable in the first cell of your notebook exactly matches the absolute path to your `WebKnoGraph` folder on Google Drive.
- Always perform a **Runtime -> Disconnect and delete runtime** before re-running.

## ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.backend.data.some_module' (or similar):
- Check your file paths (`!ls -R "/content/drive/My Drive/WebKnoGraph"`) to ensure the module file (`some_module.py`) is physically located at the path implied by the import (`src/backend/data/`).
- Ensure there's an `__init__.py` file (even if empty) in every directory along the import path (e.g., `src/backend/__init__.py`, `src/backend/data/__init__.py`).
- Verify the exact case-sensitivity of folder and file names.
- Confirm you have copy-pasted the entire content into the file and saved it correctly. An empty or syntax-error-laden file will also cause this.
- Always perform a **Runtime -> Disconnect and delete runtime** before re-running.

## ImportError: generic_type: type "ExplainType" is already registered!" (for duckdb):
- This typically indicates a conflict from multiple installations or an unclean session.
- Perform a **Runtime -> Disconnect and delete runtime** and then run all cells from scratch. Ensure the `!pip install` commands run in the very first cell before any other imports.

## KeyError in RecommendationEngine / Dropdown Issues:
- Ensure the model training pipeline completes successfully first.
- After training, manually select a valid URL from the dropdown for recommendations. The dropdown might initially show a placeholder if artifacts don't exist.
- If retraining, ensure old output artifacts are cleared or overwritten.
